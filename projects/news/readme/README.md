## Work process
Think tank to come up with an idea for the assignment.
Idea about a newspage with some functionality started to take form.
Scouted for a API that would work and started to test fetching data from the API.
Implemented bootstrap to the project structured my DOM with HTML & CSS.
Implemented the functionality of the page, fetching information and displaying it on the DOM.
Created my own API from a json-server to store saved news and in turn show them on the DOM.
